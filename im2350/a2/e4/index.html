          I have recently developed an interest in industrial Drum and Bass (DnB) music, alongside an appreciation 
          for the visual aesthetics of Hyperpop. I believe that the fusion of these auditory and visual elements 
          encapsulates the cultural essence of the 'inner north youth' of Melbourne. Despite occasional instances
           of what may seem like pretentiousness or ostentation, I have discovered a unique allure in this 
           unconventional chic. My design goals with this project were to convey this thematic essence through 
           interactive design and a strategic visual hierarchy within this assignment.

To achieve this, I embarked on the creation of both a custom video and song for this project, while also designing 
harmonious and distinctive button designs for website interactivity. The choice of a DS frame for the video, 
paired with a 'liquid jungle DnB' soundtrack featuring footage of graffiti-covered drainpipes in North Melbourne's 
industrial area, served to effectively communicate the desired theme. The button design, inspired by the buttons of a 
Nintendo DS console, further contributed to the rebellious undertones of the project by encouraging user exploration 
rather than providing explicit guidance.

Although I encountered challenges with SVG image distortion that I regrettably lacked the time to resolve, I did 
incorporate a volume control slider, recognizing that this project assumes an exhibition-like format. The chosen
 colour palette, which incorporates RGB elements complemented by darker shades, was carefully curated to reflect
  the visual content of the video and enhance overall contrast. These contrasting elements were also intended to 
  align with the overarching theme I aimed to convey.
