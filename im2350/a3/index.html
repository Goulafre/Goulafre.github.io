    -Design Core-

This artistic project is centred on the themes of birth, death, decay, introspection, growth, and grief.
 These emotions are intrinsically linked to the natural world, where life is continually composted. 
 The drag interaction was chosen to symbolise the profound weight of this action, mirroring the
  consequences of holding and letting go, much like the ebb and flow of life. The minimal 
  interactivity serves as an abstraction of our existence, and the decision to embrace natural
   elements is evident in the animations and images that draw inspiration from the natural world. 
   The ultimate objective of this project was to convey a narrative encompassing my personal perception
    of death and life, intricately interwoven with the profound beauty and the underlying sense of 
    tranquillity that accompanies the return to the embrace of nature. This endeavour sought to 
    encapsulate these themes with a meticulous focus on aesthetic and thematic resonance.

-Slider-

The drag interaction is harnessed within two sliders that house the primary image. While my initial vision 
had included arched sliders, time constraints prevented me from realizing that aspiration. Nevertheless,
 I derive satisfaction from the harmonious functionality of the two sliders. They symbolize the seasons 
 and districts of nature and life, emphasizing our interconnection with the natural world. As modern 
 inhabitants of Melbourne, it is easy to lose sight of our place within nature. The interactivity of 
 the sliders triggers changes in the background colour, loops natural animations, and causes Haikus
  to appear and disappear, encapsulating the core designs in this poetic format.

-Styling-

The design choices, including the colour palette, icons, and animations, are rooted in my personal 
emotions and memories tied to nature. Growing up in the Tasmanian forest, I was often captivated by 
the morning sunlight filtering through the leaves' blades, evoking a sense of ethereal wonder and hope.
 The falling leaves' waltz introduced me to the early perceptions of death, decay, and rebirth.
  Rain and bodies of water served as reflective elements, inviting introspection. The icons were crafted 
  in Illustrator, aiming to embody the mystic and enigmatic atmosphere I aimed to convey. The colour 
  palette was chosen to resonate with the emotions evoked by the animations, such as the colours of 
  morning sunrays. This project was intentionally designed to be a deeply personal and intimate 
  expression of myself.

-Reflection-

This project closely aligns with my initial vision. While I had aspired to create a subtle arc 
in both sliders, time constraints prevented this implementation. Additionally, I had attempted 
to incorporate datalist markers, where interactions could trigger animations if markers were hit
 upon contact by both the slider handles, and to signify that the value would host an interactable. 
 However, the hover feature on the sliders serves as a clear indication of interactivity. 
 In the end, coding proved to be a challenging yet rewarding endeavour, and I believe that I 
 have successfully crafted a digital space and atmosphere in line with my creative objectives.
