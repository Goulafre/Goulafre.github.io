    <button class="accordion">What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The bright pink text juxtaposed against a black screen. After my first few interactions with the website, I understood I was a creature in a poisonous hole and the contrast really emphasised and complemented the feeling of being somewhere dark, abysmal and curious.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <div class="image-container"><img id="img1" src="img/greenart@2x.png" width="100%" /></div>

    
    <script>
      var sound1 = new buzz.sound("sound/q2.wav");
      window.onload = function() {
                document.getElementById('img1').addEventListener('click',function () {sound1.play();});
              };
      </script>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I was engaged with reading the text as it was coming up, as it was generating at an average reading speed. Every time I interacted with the website (clicking on buttons that would signify if was clickable by changing shape, size and colour when I hovered the mouse over it) more text would generate, progressing the narrative. 
      </p>
    </div>


    <button class="accordion">What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the 
      experience?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Navigating the main screen by interacting with the available actions that would pop up when progression in the narrative was being done. This was done by hovering my mouse over buttons that would signify that they could be clicked by the way the changed form. When clicked, they would change again and more text would appear, allowing the user to know that this was the correct interaction for progression.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I feel that the intended primary goal for this interactive experience was to engage with the my imagination. I felt that the minimalist aesthetic and generative glitch art gave me a substantial foundation to create a linked experience from the text, actions, aesthetic with my own personal imagination and experiences to create a communal narrative in my head. It feels as though they really pushed this, and having irreversible choices felt as of this imagination realm had dire choices, almost like another life. With just enough narrative setting, the website guided my imagination to explore this world, and let me unluck history and knowledge about my character and the world around me. A world in which I create, form, and linger connections through my imagination and interactions.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The interactive experience has descriptive narrative text that generates based on what I interact with in my environment. This text allows me to see the choices I have made, and a description of my virtual environment. Along with the neon glitch art that changes based on what area of the world I am in signifies the change of atmosphere in location. These accumulate into an orchestra of tools inviting my imagination to play along with their narrative. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I feel that this experience is meant to be interacted for a substantial duration, as I explored the virtual environment. The more interactions spent in this game sent me deeper into the narrative, forming emotional bonds in this otherworldly life. It fostered curiosity, invigorating me to explore and dive in a ubiquitous immersion into the world. It also invites replayability, as the choices you make are certain. And irreversible. This means that each new time you reload the page and embark on a new interactive journey, you are inspired to choose different choices and explore a different life. 

        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>This interactive experience communicates that it should have time invested in this website by the generative text that progresses the narrative. The further I interacted with the website; more clickable options became available. It can be considered that the experience understands that I want to click more, as when I do, I am rewarded with more text. The more text, the more world building and bonds are formed, quenching the thirst of my knowledge and creative curiosity. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>It references an interactive journey, perhaps a choose your own adventure novel, or a game that requires creativity and imagination, like <i>D&D.</i> It felt very similar to games from an older generation, where graphics weren’t as advanced – making me use my imagination to form my own experience. A kind of nostalgic blast, such as early <i>Pokémon</i> games, or <i>Caves of Qud.</i> This form of media is becoming rarer, and I value its purpose. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The experience encourages me to continue clicking on the interactives, as it transforms the narrative – the main component of the experience. By continuing to click and read, the interactive website becomes an immersive tool, and therefore lets my know that I am able to utilise my imagination. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>It feel as though I am able to trust the website, as I can expose my imaginative world building alongside their guidance, creative a collaborative environment. </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I am a fast reader, and the time it takes for text to appear can be quite frustrating. If there was an option to adjust text speed, I feel as though that would make the interactive website more enjoyable. I often found myself exiting a state of immersion and entering a state of slight frustration while waiting for the text to appear. Maybe they did this on purpose, to make me linger around the website for longer, or maybe it is a flaw. Either way, I know I would appreciate a more user-friendly design.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="baseline">
    <button class="accordion">What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
      </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I felt being able to choose my name and the name of my companions was satisfying, as customisation is an important aspect for any videogame. I am especially enthusiastic about it, as I feel a form of connection through my avatar. 
        I felt the absence of any instructions was satisfying, mainly because it juxtaposed against the mainstream media that now holds your hand through every experience. I value when digital art can <em>show but not tell.</em>
